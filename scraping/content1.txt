            </ul>

                    here</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Let’s Begin the application Process:</strong></p>
            <p>After opening the application, a student will be able to see the following;</p>
            <p><strong>A university Application:</strong></p>
            <p>An applicant is directed to apply for the field of interest or course in any of the 3 eligible
                universities for Chevening international scholarship. An applicant doesn’t need an admission letter at
                this stage. An applicant is not even bound to be consistent with the selected universities when an
                applicant gets shortlisted for an interview, he/she may change his/her preference for the university.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Experience Letter:</strong></p>
            <p>At the time of the application process, an applicant is not supposed to submit the experience letter. An
                applicant can upload the certificates later.</p>
            <p><strong>IETLS:</strong></p>
            <p>You do not need to have IELTS at this point, once you are selected you will have a timeline to submit
                IELTS by July, 14.</p>
            <p>We strongly recommend submitting your IELTS test result by the End of November or at the start of
                December. It will create a positive impact on your application. It will also strengthen your Chevening
                application and therefore your chances of selection will be more. Secondly, you will have much time to
                improve your score, if you could not achieve the desired band. One more thing you must also check the
                university’s requirements before applying.</p>
            <p><strong>See, what Chevening Scholarship UK Alumni suggest:</strong></p>
            <p>Candidates should apply for 5 to 6 universities to secure as many admissions as they can because if a
                candidate wouldn’t secure admission in the top 3 selected universities, his application might get
                secured in the other 4 or 5 nominated universities.</p>
            <p>A candidate must apply for a similar course in each university in the application form. It will propose
                your study plan and your interest in professional development. Moreover, it will save you time as your
                personal statement would not need mush changes for applying.</p>
            <p>Kindly don’t fill out the application in a hurry, make a draft and review your application again and
                again. Every component of the application must be relevant to each other.</p>
            <p>Don’t wait for a deadline to submit an application, the system gets crashed in the last hours. So be
                careful and submit the application before the deadline.</p>
            <p>We are hoping that these guidelines will help you out to be a successful candidate.</p>
            <p>Best of Luck!</p>
